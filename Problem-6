#Project Euler Problem 6

#find the sum of squares of the first hundred natural numbers and the square 
#of the sum, then the difference.

#Python Solution

list_1 = []
list_2 = []

def sum_of_squares ():
  for x in range (1, 101):
    list_1.append(x**2)
  return sum(list_1)

def square_of_sums():
  for x in range (1, 101):
    list_2.append(x)
  return sum(list_2) * sum(list_2)
  
print(square_of_sums() - sum_of_squares())


#R Solution

numbers <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 1)
answer <- sum(numbers)^2 - sum(numbers^2)
print(paste(answer))
