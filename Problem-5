#Project Euler Problem 5

#Smallest number evenly divisible by all numbers 1 to 20


#Python Solution

import math

def problem_five():
	answer = 1
	for x in range(1, 21):
		answer *= x // math.gcd(x, answer)
	return str(answer)
 
print(problem_five())


#R Solution

#Without the handy math module in python, 
#we need to code a function to find the gcd

#this is a coded version of the euclidean algorithm

euclidean_algorithm_gcd <- function (x, y) {
    start <- 0
    while (y != 0) {
        start <- y
        y <- x %% y
        x <- start}
    x
}

factors <- seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 1)
answer <- 1

for (a in factors){
  answer <- answer * (a %/% euclidean_algorithm_gcd(a, answer))}
  print(paste(answer))
